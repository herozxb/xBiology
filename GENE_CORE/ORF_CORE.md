# 1	CORE technology, CRISPR-Cas9

Components of CRISPR-Cas9 Genome Editing:

Cas9 Protein:Derived from bacterial species (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes).
Functions as a molecular "scissors" that can cut DNA at specific target sequences.

Guide RNA (gRNA):Consists of a CRISPR-derived RNA sequence (complementary to the target DNA) and a scaffold sequence.
Directs Cas9 to the desired DNA target site through sequence complementarity.

# 2 	ORF, get the ORF position and change it into other sequence of ear, you may make a ear protein in some other vector animal

# 3	logic of gene editing, you change the stem cell gene, then it can grow the protein, and make a eye, but after the eye is made, the change of cell gene, the eye may not be change, because the cell of eye will not divide and generate, what if we start the cell to divide by man, is it going to be a mal-form of eye, maybe
# 4 	traverse the gene, you may meet the gene in the database which has label of their function, then stop traversing

# 5 	Hayflick Limit, this limit is estimated to be around 40-60 divisions for most human somatic cells. Telomeres: Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences located at the ends of chromosomes. They protect the integrity of chromosomes and prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with neighboring chromosomes.

# 6 	Role of Telomerase: Telomerase is an enzyme that can add nucleotide repeats to telomeres, thus counteracting telomere shortening and extending the lifespan of cells. Telomerase activity is typically high in stem cells, germ cells, and some cancer cells, allowing these cells to divide more times than somatic cells. Cellular Senescence: Once cells reach their Hayflick limit or encounter other stress signals, they undergo cellular senescence, where they cease to divide and become metabolically active but non-dividing. This process contributes to aging and limits the regenerative capacity of tissues.
