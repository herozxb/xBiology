# 1	CORE technology, CRISPR-Cas9

Components of CRISPR-Cas9 Genome Editing:

Cas9 Protein:Derived from bacterial species (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes).
Functions as a molecular "scissors" that can cut DNA at specific target sequences.

Guide RNA (gRNA):Consists of a CRISPR-derived RNA sequence (complementary to the target DNA) and a scaffold sequence.
Directs Cas9 to the desired DNA target site through sequence complementarity.
